                Articact ID:  basicapp
      Archetype Artifact ID:  maven-archetype-quickstart
          Archetype Version:  1.0

	Note:  The Artifact ID is the sub-folder name that will be created in the Project Name folder of Step 2.




STEP 5.
	In the command below, transcribe Step 4 contents into the relative 
        fields.

	At the command line, run:  

		mvn archetype:generate   -DgroupId=com.basicapp.app   -DartifactId=basicapp   -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart   -DarchetypeVersion=1.0   -DinteractiveMode=false

	Navigate to the sub-folder created.
	This sub-folder has the auto-generated files and structure of a Maven app.
	At the command line, run:  

		mvn package

	Among other things, the above command creates a subdirectory called "target".  In
	that subdirectory, among other things there is a file called "basicapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" 
	which contains the binary of the java application.



STEP 7. 
	Test the application.
